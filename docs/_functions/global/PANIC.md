`PANIC` terminates the script and therefore DnsControl with an exit code of 1. This should be used if your script cannot gather enough information to generate records, for example when a HTTP request failed.

{% capture example %}
```js
PANIC("Something really bad has happened");
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include example.html content=example %}
