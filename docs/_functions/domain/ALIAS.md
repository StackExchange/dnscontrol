ALIAS is a virtual record type that points a record at another record. It is analogous to a CNAME, but is usually resolved at request-time and served as an A record. Unlike CNAMEs, ALIAS records can be used at the zone apex (`@`)

Different providers handle ALIAS records differently, and many do not support it at all. Attempting to use ALIAS records with a DNS provider type that does not support them will result in an error.

The name should be the relative label for the domain.

Target should be a string representing the target. If it is a single label we will assume it is a relative name on the current domain. If it contains *any* dots, it should be a fully qualified domain name, ending with a `.`.
