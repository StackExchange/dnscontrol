`CF_REDIRECT` uses Cloudflare-specific features ("Forwarding URL" Page Rules) to
generate a HTTP 301 permanent redirect.

If _any_ `CF_REDIRECT` or `CF_TEMP_REDIRECT` functions are used then
`dnscontrol` will manage _all_ "Forwarding URL" type Page Rules for the domain.
Page Rule types other than "Forwarding URL‚Äù will be left alone.

WARNING: Cloudflare does not currently fully document the Page Rules API and
this interface is not extensively tested. Take precautions such as making
backups and manually verifying `dnscontrol preview` output before running
`dnscontrol push`. This is especially true when mixing Page Rules that are
managed by DNSControl and those that aren't.

HTTP 301 redirects are cached by browsers forever, usually ignoring any TTLs or
other cache invalidation techniques. It should be used with great care. We
suggest using a `CF_TEMP_REDIRECT` initially, then changing to a `CF_REDIRECT`
only after sufficient time has elapsed to prove this is what you really want.

This example redirects the bare (aka apex, or naked) domain to www:

{% include startExample.html %}
{% highlight js %}
D("foo.com", .... ,
  CF_REDIRECT("mydomain.com/*", "https://www.mydomain.com/$1"),
);
{%endhighlight%}
{% include endExample.html %}
