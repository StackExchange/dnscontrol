<h1> Provider Features </h1>

<p>The table below shows various features supported, or not supported by DNSControl providers.
  Underlined items have tooltips for more detailed explanation. This table is automatically generated
  from metadata supplied by the provider when they register themselves inside dnscontrol.
</p>
<p>
  An empty space may indicate the feature is not supported by a provider, or it may simply mean
  the feature has not been investigated and implemented yet. If a feature you need is missing from 
  a provider that supports it, we'd love your contribution to ensure it works correctly and add it to this matrix.
