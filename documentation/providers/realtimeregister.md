[realtimeregister.com](https://realtimeregister.com) is a domain registrar based in the Netherlands.

## Configuration

To use this provider, add an entry to `creds.json` with `TYPE` set to `REALTIMEREGISTER`
along with your API-key. Further configuration includes a flag indicating BASIC or PREMIUM DNS-service and a flag
indicating the use of the sandbox environment

**Example:**

{% code title="creds.json" %}
```json
{
  "realtimeregister": {
    "TYPE": "REALTIMEREGISTER",
    "apikey": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890",
    "sandbox" : "0",
    "premium" : "0"
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

If sandbox is omitted or set to any other value than "1" the production API will be used.
If premium is set to "1", you will only be able to update zones using Premium DNS. If it is omitted or set to any other value, you
will only be able to update zones using Basic DNS.

**Important Notes**:
* Anyone with access to this `creds.json` file will have *full* access to your RTR account and will be able to transfer or delete your domains
