`IMPORT_TRANSFORM_STRIP` is the same as `IMPORT_TRANSFORM` with an additional parameter: `suffixstrip`.

When `IMPORT_TRANSFORM_STRIP` is generating the label for new records, it
checks the label.  If the label ends with `.` + `suffixstrip`, that suffix is removed.
If the label does not end with `suffixstrip`, an error is returned.

For CNAMEs, the `suffixstrip` is stripped from the beginning (prefix) of the target domain.

For example, if the domain is `com.extra` and the label is `foo.com`,
`IMPORT_TRANSFORM` would generate a label `foo.com.com.extra`.
`IMPORT_TRANSFORM_STRIP(... , 'com')` would generate
the label `foo.com.extra` instead.

In the case of a CNAME, if the target is `foo.com.`, the new target would be `foo.com.extra`.
