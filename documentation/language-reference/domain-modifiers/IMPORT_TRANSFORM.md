{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't use this feature. It was added for a very specific situation at Stack Overflow.
{% endhint %}

`IMPORT_TRANSFORM` adds to the domain the records from another
domain, after making certain transformations and resetting the TTL.

Not all records are copied and transformed:
* The record must be record type A or CNAME.
* Records are skipped if they have a metadata key `import_transform_skip` (any non-null value).
* Records are skipped if a record of the same label+type already exist in the destination domain.

Example:

Suppose foo.com is a regular domain.  bar.com is a regular domain,
but certain records should be the same as foo.com with these
exceptions: "bar.com" is added to the name, the TTL is changed to
300, if the IP address is between 1.2.3.10 and 1.2.3.20 then rewrite
the IP address to be based on 123.123.123.100 (i.e. .113 or .114).

You wouldn't want to maintain bar.com manually, would you?  It would
be very error prone. Therefore instead you maintain foo.com and
let `IMPORT_TRANSFORM` automatically generate bar.com.

```text
foo.com:
    one.foo.com.    IN A 1.2.3.1
    two.foo.com.    IN A 1.2.3.2
    three.foo.com.  IN A 1.2.3.13
    four.foo.com.   IN A 1.2.3.14

bar.com:
    www.bar.com.    IN 123.123.123.123
    one.foo.com.bar.com.    IN A 1.2.3.1
    two.foo.com.bar.com.    IN A 1.2.3.2
    three.foo.com.bar.com.  IN A 123.123.123.113
    four.foo.com.bar.com.   IN A 123.123.123.114
```

Here's how you'd implement this in DNSControl:

{% code title="dnsconfig.js" %}
```javascript
// Transforms that use newBase:
var TRANSFORM_CF = [
    // RANGE_START, RANGE_END, NEW_BASE
    { low: "1.2.3.10", high: "1.2.3.20", newBase: "123.123.123.100" },  //   .10 to .20 rewritten as 123.123.123.100+IP
    { low: "2.4.6.80", high: "2.4.6.90", newBase: "123.123.123.200" },  //   Another rule, just to show that you can have many.
]
// Transforms that use newIP
var TRANSFORM_FSTLY = [
    // RANGE_START, RANGE_END, NEW_BASE
    { low: "1.2.3.10", high: "1.2.3.10", newIP: "123.123.123.100" },  //   .10 is rewritten as 123.123.123.100
    { low: "2.4.6.20", high: "2.4.6.20", newIP: "123.123.123.200" },  //   .20 is rewritten as 123.123.123.200
]

D("foo.com", REG_MY_PROVIDER, DnsProvider(DSP_MY_PROVIDER),
  A("one","1.2.3.1"),
  A("two","1.2.3.2"),
  A("three","1.2.3.13"),
  A("four","1.2.3.14"),
END);

D("bar.com", REG_MY_PROVIDER, DnsProvider(DSP_MY_PROVIDER),
  A("www","123.123.123.123"),
  IMPORT_TRANSFORM(TRANSFORM_CF, "foo.com", 300),
END);

D("baz.com", REG_MY_PROVIDER, DnsProvider(DSP_MY_PROVIDER),
  A("www","123.123.123.123"),
  IMPORT_TRANSFORM(TRANSFORM_FSTLY, "foo.com", 300),
END);
```
{% endcode %}

Transform rules are: `RANGE_START`, `RANGE_END`, `NEW_BASE` or `NEW_IP`.

Only one of `newBase` and `newBase` may be specified. If both are non-null the behavior is undefined.

`NEW_BASE` works as follows:

* An IP address.  Rebase the IP address on this IP address. Extract the host part of the /24 and add it to the "new base" address.
* A list of IP addresses. For each A record, inject an A record for each item in the list: `newBase: ["1.2.3.100", "2.4.6.8.100"]` would produce 2 records for each A record.
* For CNAMEs, the `.internal` is appended to the end of the target.

`NEW_IP` works as follows:

* An IP address.  Change the IP address of the A record to this IP address. If there are multiple A records at this label, only one A record is generated.
* A list of IP addresses. Not supported.
* For CNAMEs, the `.internal` is appended to the end of the target. (same as `NEW_BASE`)
