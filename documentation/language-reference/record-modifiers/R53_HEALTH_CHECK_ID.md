`R53_HEALTH_CHECK_ID` associates a [Route 53 health check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-creating.html) with a record. This is typically used in combination with [`R53_WEIGHT()`](R53_WEIGHT.md) for weighted routing, so that Route 53 stops routing traffic to unhealthy endpoints.

The `health_check_id` is the ID of a Route 53 health check that you create separately (e.g. via the AWS Console, CLI, or Terraform). DNSControl does not manage the health checks themselves, only their association with DNS records.
