**NOTE**: This provider is currently has no maintainer. We are looking for
a volunteer. If this provider breaks it may be disabled or removed if
it can not be easily fixed.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

To use this provider, add an entry to `creds.json` with `TYPE` set to `NAMEDOTCOM`
along with your name.com API username and access token:

Example:

{% code title="creds.json" %}
```json
{
  "name.com": {
    "TYPE": "NAMEDOTCOM",
    "apikey": "yourApiKeyFromName.com",
    "apiuser": "yourUsername"
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

There is another key name `apiurl` but it is optional and defaults to the correct value. If you want to use the test environment ("OT&E"), then add this:

    "apiurl": "https://api.dev.name.com",

export NAMEDOTCOM_URL='api.name.com'


## Metadata
This provider does not recognize any special metadata fields unique to name.com.

## Usage

An example `dnsconfig.js` configuration with NAMEDOTCOM
as the registrar and DNS service provider:

{% code title="dnsconfig.js" %}
```javascript
var REG_NAMECOM = NewRegistrar("name.com");
var DSP_NAMECOM = NewDnsProvider("name.com");

D("example.com", REG_NAMECOM, DnsProvider(DSP_NAMECOM),
    A("test", "1.2.3.4"),
END);
```
{% endcode %}

An example `dnsconfig.js` configuration with NAMEDOTCOM
as the registrar and DNS only, DNS hosted elsewhere:

{% code title="dnsconfig.js" %}
```javascript
var REG_NAMECOM = NewRegistrar("name.com");
var DSP_R53 = NewDnsProvider("r53");

D("example.com", REG_NAMECOM, DnsProvider(DSP_R53),
    A("test","1.2.3.4"),
END);
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: name.com does not allow control over the NS records of your zones via the api. It is not recommended to use name.com's dns provider unless it is your only dns host.
{% endhint %}

## Activation
In order to activate API functionality on your Name.com account, you must apply to the API program. The application form is [located here](https://www.name.com/reseller/apply). It usually takes a few days to get a response. After you are accepted, you should receive your API token via email.

## Tips and error messages

### invalid character '<'

```text
integration_test.go:140: api returned unexpected response: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value
```

This error means an invalid URL is being used to reach the API
endpoint.  It usually means a setting is `api.name.com/api` when
`api.name.com` is correct (i.e. remove the `/api`).

In integration tests:

 * Wrong: `export NAMEDOTCOM_URL='api.name.com/api'`
 * Right: `export NAMEDOTCOM_URL='api.name.com'`

In production, the `apiurl` setting in `creds.json` is wrong. You can
simply leave this option out and use the default, which is correct.

TODO(tlim): Improve the error message. (Volunteer needed!)


### dial tcp: lookup https: no such host

```text
integration_test.go:81: Failed getting nameservers Get https://https//api.name.com/api/v4/domains/stackosphere.com?: dial tcp: lookup https: no such host
```

When running integration tests, this error
means you included the `https://` in the `NAMEDOTCOM_URL` variable.
You meant to do something like `export NAMEDOTCOM_URL='api.name.com' instead.

In production, the `apiurl` setting in `creds.json` needs to be
adjusted. You can simply leave this option out and use the default,
which is correct. If you are using the EO&T system, leave the
protocol (`http://`) off the URL.
