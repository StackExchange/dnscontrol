/*
Sadly many providers handle TXT records in strange and unexpeected
ways.  DNSControl has to handle all of them.  Over the years we've
tried many things.  This explain the current state of the code.

DNSControl stores the TXT record target as a single string of any length.
Providers take care of any splitting, excaping, or quoting.

NOTE: Older versions of DNSControl stored the TXT record as
represented by the provider, which could be a single string, a series
of smaller strings, or a single string that is quoted/escaped.  This
created tons of edge-cases and other distractions.

If a provider doesn't support certain charactors in a TXT record, use
the providers/$PROVIDER/auditrecords.go file to indicate this.
DNSControl uses this information to warn users of unsupporrted input,
and to skip related integration tests.

There are 2 ways to create a TXT record:
	SetTargetTXT():  Create from a string.
	SetTargetTXTs(): Create from an array of strings that need to be joined.

There are 2 ways to get the value (target) of a TXT record:
	GetTargetTXTJoined(): Returns one big string
	GetTargetTXTSegmented(): Returns an array 255-octet segments.
