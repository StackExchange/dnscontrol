# Security Policy

DNSControl is a command-line tool and therefore has a different (limited) attack surface as compared to a web app or other system.

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent release is supported with security updates.

When a major version is incremented, we'll support the previous major version for 6 months. For example, when v4.0 is released, we will support the most recent v3.x release for 6 months.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability please [create a new Github "issue"](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/issues/new/choose).

We will respond in a best-effort manner, usually within 1 week. We will communciate via the Github issue unless we need to communicate privately, in which case we'll arrange a way to communicate directly.
