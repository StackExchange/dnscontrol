## Release changelog section

Help keep the release changelog clear by pre-naming the proper section in the GitHub pull request title.

Some examples:
* CICD: Add required GHA permissions for goreleaser
* DOCS: Fixed providers with "contributor support" table
* ROUTE53: Allow R53_ALIAS records to enable target health evaluation

More examples/context can be found in the file .goreleaser.yml under the 'build' > 'changelog' key.
