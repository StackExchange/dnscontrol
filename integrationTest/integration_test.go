	//     not("ROUTE53"), only("GCLOUD"),  // ERROR!
	// NOTE: All requires()/not()/only() must appear before any tc().

	// tc()
	// Each tc() indicates a set of records.  The testgroup tries to
	// migrate from one tc() to the next.  For example the first tc()
	// creates some records. The next tc() might list the same records
	// but adds 1 new record and omits 1.  Therefore migrating to this
	// second tc() results in 1 record being created and 1 deleted; but
	// for some providers it may be converting 1 record to another.
	// Therefore some testgroups are testing the providers ability to
	// transition between different states. Others are just testing
	// whether or not a certain kind of record can be created and
	// deleted.

	// emptyzone() is the same as tc("Empty").  It removes all records.
	// Each testgroup() begins with tcEmptyZone() automagically. You do not
	// have to include the tcEmptyZone() in each testgroup().

		// START HERE

		// Narrative:  Hello friend!  Are you adding a new DNS provider to
		// DNSControl? That's awesome!  I'm here to help.
		//
		// As you write your code, these tests will help verify that your
		// code is correct and covers all the funny edge-cases that DNS
		// providers throw at us.
		//
		// If you follow these sections marked "Narrative", I'll lead you
		// through the tests. The tests start by testing very basic things
		// (are you talking to the API correctly) and then moves on to
		// more and more esoteric issues.  It's like a video game where
		// you have to solve all the levels but the game lets you skip
		// around as long as all the levels are completed eventually.  Some
		// of the levels you can mark "not relevant" for your provider.
		//
		// Oh wait. I'm getting ahead of myself.  How do you run these
		// tests?  That's documented here:
		// https://docs.dnscontrol.org/developer-info/integration-tests
		// You'll be running these tests a lot. I recommend you make a
		// script that sets the environment variables and runs the tests
		// to make it easy to run the tests.  However don't check that
		// file into a GIT repo... it contains API credentials that are
		// secret!

		///// Basic functionality (add/rename/change/delete).

		// Narrative:  Let's get started!  The first thing to do is to
		// make sure we can create an A record, change it, then delete it.
		// That's the basic Add/Change/Delete process.  Once these three
		// features work you know that your API calls and authentication
		// is working and we can do the most basic operations.

		// Narrative: Congrats! You're done!  If you've made it this far

		// some tips:

		// 1. Ask for help!  It is normal to submit a PR when most (but
		//    not all) tests are passing.  The community would be glad to
		//    help fix the remaining tests.
		// 2. Take a moment to clean up your code. Delete debugging
		//    statements, add comments, run "staticcheck".
		// 3. Thing change: Once your PR is accepted, re-run these tests
		//    every quarter. There may be library updates, API changes,
		//    etc.

		// This SHOULD be the last test. We do this so that we always
		// leave zones with a single TXT record exclaming our success.
		// Nothing depends on this record existing or should depend on it.
